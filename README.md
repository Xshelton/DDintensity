Github of Addressing Imbalanced Drug-Drug Interaction Risk Levels in Datasets using Pre-trained Deep Learning Model Embeddings (DDintensity):

Steps of reproducing DDintensity:
Drug Features files:
Embeddings extracted from different pre-trained deep-learning models
The drug features extracted from different deep learning models can be found:
__________________
Constructed dataset:
DDI_Major1_114958.csv

* Step one:  building Embedding dataset  
First, make sure we have folders:0_drug_feature_pool  
and put unzipped drug features files into the folder 0_drug_feature_pool  
change 
keys='DinoVitb16' in dataset_construction.py  
run the file  
it will generate an embedding dataset for ML downstream tasks.  
Generally look like
For pre-train deep learning of DinoVit, the files should looks like:  
0DDI_Major1_vDinoVitb16_dDinoVitb16_frs_0_rs0.csv  
For pre-trained deep learning of Biogpt, the files should looks like:  
0DDI_Major1_vbioGPTesum_dbioGPTesum_frs_0_rs0.csv   
'DinoVitb16' ,'bioGPTesum' are the key to selecting the pre-trained deep learning models and an identifier for the following experiments.  

* Step 2: Building 5 folds embedding dataset
in .\Embedding dataset\ï¼š  
Copy-paste and rename the last number from 0-4:  
0DDI_Major1_v{}_d{}_frs_0_rs0.csv  
0DDI_Major1_v{}_d{}_frs_0_rs1.csv  
0DDI_Major1_v{}_d{}_frs_0_rs2.csv  
0DDI_Major1_v{}_d{}_frs_0_rs3.csv  
0DDI_Major1_v{}_d{}_frs_0_rs4.csv  
And run 
Step2 embedding 2 filesfolds.py  
Please change:  
vkey='DinoVitb16'  
dkey='DinoVitb16'  
Into the pre-trained deep learning models name:  
We don't use any negative sampling. Thus, the imbalanced dataset can be the same. We only need to change the random seeds to cut the dataset.  
All 5folds embedding files are in:  
0DDI_Major1_feature_pod\5folds  

* Step3: run prediction files using:
the put the pytorch_read_csv(Attention_LSTMmodel) biogpt-.py into 
Embedding dataset\0DDI_Major1_feature_pod\  
run pytorch_read_csv(Attention_LSTMmodel) biogpt-.py  

Make sure you have corresponding 5-fold embedding files in:  
Embedding dataset\0DDI_Major1_feature_pod\5folds   
Should name like this:    
0DDI_Major1_v{key}_d{key}_frs_0_rs{rs for cutting file}_epoch{epoch}.csv  
0DDI_Major1_v{key}_d{key}_frs_0_rs{rs for cutting file}_epoch{epoch}_test.csv  
for e.g:  
0DDI_Major1_vbioGPTesum_dbioGPTesum_frs_0_rs0_epoch1.csv  
0DDI_Major1_vbioGPTesum_dbioGPTesum_frs_0_rs0_epoch1_test.csv    
In total of five-fold cross validation, and five repeation, it will generate 50 files for each experiments.  


it will automatically generate scores of the DDI_test in the valid_results folder  
and generate a scores file for five-fold cross-validation
